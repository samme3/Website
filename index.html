<p> So what is <strong> Shrek? </strong> There is a wikipedia article here to show you what it is. </p>
<a href =" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_(franchise)"> Here it is </a>

<p> So now that you know what <strong> Shrek </strong> is I will list the <strong> Shrek </strong> movies from best to worst with reviews (not made by me) in <a href = "Website 2 page 1.html"> this page. </a> </p> 

<br>

<p> Or, if you really want you can just have an empty page. It has some <strong> Shrek </strong> trivia as well! <a href ="Emptypage.html"> here </a> </p>

<br>

<p> This is a <strong> Shrek </strong> fact file with facts such his date of birth and where he lives. There isn't any <strong> Shrek </strong> trivia in this because the entire page is a <strong> Shrek </strong> trivia <a href = "Shrekfact.html"> this page. </a> </p>

<a href = "https://punchedpikmin.weebly.com/shrek-shreds.html" style="color:Black;" > A great Shrek game that I would love to see adapted into a movie. It has action, romance, special affects and a lot more. I recommend playing it as it is possibly the best game ever made. </a>
