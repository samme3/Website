<a href = "https://punchedpikmin.weebly.com/shrek-shreds.html" > A great Shrek game that I would love to see adapted into a movie. It has action, romance, special affects and a lot more. I recommend playing it as it is possibly the best game ever made. It is also known as "Skate 5" to some, as it was so good they skipped skate 4. </a>
